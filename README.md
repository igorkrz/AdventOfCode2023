Golang this year :)

To run any program you first need to put input.txt inside the day directory and then run the command for example:

``go run days/1/main.go --part 2``

Part 1 is the default part to run, so you don't need to specify ``--part`` flag.
And of course don't forget to change the day when running the program :)

Happy coding!
